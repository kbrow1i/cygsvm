The following packages have been added to the Cygwin distribution:

* svm-3.20-1
* libsvm2-3.20-1
* libsvm-devel-3.20-1

LIBSVM is an integrated software for support vector classification, (C-SVC, nu-SVC), regression (epsilon-SVR, nu-SVR), and distribution estimation (one-class SVM).  It supports multi-class classification.

libsvm2 is being added to the distribution as a dependency of the next release of clisp.
